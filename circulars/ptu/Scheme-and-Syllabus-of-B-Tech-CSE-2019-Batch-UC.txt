OUTCOME OF THE COURSE:
By the end of the course, students are expected to become more aware of themselves, and their surroundings
(family, society, nature); they would become more responsible in life, and in handling problems with sustainable
solutions, while keeping human relationships and human nature in mind. They would have better critical ability.
They would also become sensitive to their commitment towards what they have understood (human values,
human relationship and human society). It is hoped that they would be able to apply what they have learnt to
their own self in different day-to-day settings in real life, at least a beginning would be made in this direction.
This is only an introductory foundational input. It would be desirable to follow it up by

a)
b)

Faculty -student or mentor-mentee programs throughout their time with the institution.
Higher level courses on human values in every aspect of living. E.g. as a professional.
